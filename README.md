# Airbus320
The main objective of this project is to showcase the Air-crash which had not taken place on 19th July 1989. United Airlines flight 232 was en route from Denver to Chicago on July 19, 1989, when the engine in the tail of the DC-10 suffered engine failure, resulting in the crashing of the plane while reaching the airport. It was one of the 13 plane crashes that changed aviation. This project focuses on the key aspects of the air crash, from the takeoff at Denver to the landing in Chicago. The above story will be presented in our OpenGL, project building using Visual Studio Code.

## Flowchart

The above figure shows the flow chart of our project.  <br>
👉🏻 When we run our project, we come to our Introduction Page with the title of the project and the details about the team members. <br>
👉🏻 When we press ‘S’ || ‘s’, we enter the Denver International Airport Scene, where the aeroplane is ready to take off from the runway. <br>
👉🏻 If key ‘E’||’e’ispressed, we exit from the scene. <br>
👉🏻 Now, by clicking the ‘F’ || ‘f’, the aeroplane flies a step forward. <br>
👉🏻 As soon as the destination airport is reached, there is a blast, and the aeroplane crashes and is into pieces. <br>
👉🏻 Again, the ‘E’ || ‘e’ key will exit out from the window. <br>
👉🏻 Use of any other key except these will result in no action. <br>

It is also significantly proven that people remember the things that they see rather than read or listen to. This is largely true as we can see user interfaces are more attractive. Computer graphics is a powerful tool in this era of mass media. <br>
Designing and implementing projects in graphics is a great experience. “Airbus 320” is an intermediate-level project. The main goal of the project is to showcase one of the airplane crashes that changed aviation. The key aspect of the Air-crash, from the takeoff at Denver to the landing in Chicago. Where the airplane crashed with a loud boom at the Chicago airport. <br>
The engine in the tail of the DC-10 suffered engine failure, resulting in the crashing of the plane while reaching the airport. This entire scene is depicted through the project made using OpenGL, inVisualStudio Code. <br>
